# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (and any other agent) working in this repository.

## What this repo is

Documentation, configuration, and knowledge capture for one ClockworkPi uConsole build
(CM4 Lite 8GB + HackerGadgets NVMe/adapter kit + OpenSourceSDRLab AIO V2), plus an RF
knowledge base that the finished device feeds.

It is mostly **not** a software project: most changes are prose, tables, checklists, and config
files that get applied to a device by hand, and "correct" mostly means accurate, sourced, and
reproducible — not compiling. The one exception is [`webdash/`](webdash/) (started 2026-09-21), a
small locally-authored Docker app — see [`docs/reference/webdash-architecture.md`](docs/reference/webdash-architecture.md)
for why it exists and [`software/webdash.md`](software/webdash.md) for running it. It has its own
build/verify loop; the rest of this file's conventions (verify markers, no secrets, living
documents) still apply to it.

## Build state (keep current)

As of 2026-09-14 the CM4 was delivered and inspected (variant confirmed CM4108000, photographs in
`images/inventory/`). The AliExpress order shipped as **two separate parcels**: the AIO V2 arrived
first (not yet unboxed/inspected) while the uConsole v3.14 mainboard was still in transit. The
microSD was flashed 2026-09-15 with `uConsole_CM4_v3.1_64bit` (read-back verified) but not yet
booted, pending the mainboard.

As of 2026-09-15 the mainboard and AIO V2 kit fully arrived, and **the device was unboxed,
mechanically assembled, and closed**: mainboard in the shell, CM4 on the kit's adapter, AIO V2 in
the expansion slot, stock battery board with an interim 2×18650 pack, display and keyboard
installed, and all 8 antennas fitted (`ANT1`–`ANT7` strip plus the SDR bulkhead).

**The device was then powered on and booted, 2026-09-16** — this is no longer a pre-power-up repo. Confirmed
on real hardware: CM4 serial/MACs, the mainboard's USB input-controller identity, PMIC voltage (1S,
3.886 V — this reading is from the interim 18650 pair, not the Meshnology LiPo, since the stock
battery board is what's installed), and the external-antenna `dtparam=ant2` setting (see
`docs/logs/build-log.md`, 2026-09-16 "First boot" entry). Software bring-up followed. No per-board
damage inspection has been done. Anything asserting device behavior beyond what has actually been
run is still sourced from vendor docs, upstream source, or forum reports and must carry a verify
marker; anything read off a photograph is a photo reading, not a measurement, and carries one too.
Photographs: `images/inventory/`.

**The HackerGadgets upgrade kit #11953 arrived 2026-09-23** — CM4/5 Adapter Pro, NVMe battery board
and RJ45+USB3 board — so the NVMe board and `JP1` are no longer absent. The **WD PC SN730 256 GB
(M.2 2280, OPAL)** was selected from the on-hand drives and fitted, and the owner reports the
boards were installed and tested. Command output for that was captured on the device later the
same day; see the next paragraph.
The other HackerGadgets order, **#12253 (AC1200 Wi-Fi card)**, **arrived and was installed
2026-09-30** and is verified on Fancy: MediaTek MT7921AUN, `wlan1` (`mt7921u`) with monitor mode on
2.4/5/6 GHz, Bluetooth on `hci1` (USB). See [`hardware/specs/ac1200-mt7921.md`](hardware/specs/ac1200-mt7921.md).

**2026-09-23: root runs from NVMe, verified on the device.** Root is `/dev/nvme0n1p2` (WD PC
SN730, reused, 21% wear, SMART `PASSED`, not OPAL-locked). EEPROM is `2026/05/17` with `BOOT_ORDER=0xf416`.
The microSD was removed 2026-09-23 and NVMe-only boot passed; the card is kept as a fallback. The earlier paragraph's "boots from microSD" and
"stock battery board" statements are superseded. The Meshnology pack is **still not fitted**; the interim 18650 pair is in the NVMe board's holder,
with **`JP1` open** (correct for 18650s) and the reverse-polarity LED **not lit** (owner, 2026-09-23). Onboard
Ethernet **links at 1 Gbps** (checklist 2.2 passes), and the pack **charges** at ~2 A from the
charger. Test results are in `docs/logs/build-log.md` (2026-09-23 entries).

**GNSS 3D fix confirmed on hardware** (first obtained 2026-09-23; recorded in detail 2026-10-04).
gpsd 3.25 over `/dev/serial0` (NMEA 0183, 9600 bps); a 2026-10-04 fix used **15 satellites** (10
GPS + 5 GLONASS) at **HDOP 0.7**, antenna reports `ANTENNA OK`. Location is held to Maidenhead grid
(EM94) — raw NMEA with coordinates is kept off-repo. Checklist 3.3 passes. **Time to first fix is
not yet measured** (the capture opened already fixed); a cold-reset timed run is tracked in
[`TODO.md`](TODO.md). See [`knowledge/rf-fundamentals/findings/2026-10-04-first-fix.md`](knowledge/rf-fundamentals/findings/2026-10-04-first-fix.md)
and `software/gps.md`.

Open blockers:
- **The interim 18650 pack in service is unverified**, and the device powered on before that was
  resolved. The fitted cells are wrapped `9900mAh` — roughly 2.8× what an 18650 physically holds —
  with no brand or batch code, in a **parallel** 1S pair. Weigh, voltage-match, and capacity-test
  them — [`docs/logs/known-issues.md`](docs/logs/known-issues.md). They were meant to be temporary
  until the NVMe battery board arrived; **it now has**, so the swap to the Meshnology LiPo is
  unblocked.
- **`JP1` is open** (owner, 2026-09-23), correct for the 18650s now fitted. It must be **soldered
  closed before the Meshnology LiPo goes on** — a current-path setting, not a preference. Its
  board location is still unrecorded.
- **The Meshnology pack's PH2.0 connector has not been matched against the board.** Confirm type
  and polarity with a meter before connecting. Order record: Amazon #114-7650902-4482665
  (2026-09-09, $42.79/pair).
- **Pack energy is unmeasured.** The runtime numbers in
  [`docs/reference/power-budget.md`](docs/reference/power-budget.md) were re-sized 2026-09-23 to
  the Meshnology 37 Wh pack on the measured ~5.0 W idle, but usable Wh is still an estimate until a
  full discharge, and the fitted 18650s have no capacity figure at all.
- **The 18650 cells have no purchase record at all** — provenance unknown. See Discrepancies in
  [`docs/checklists/inventory-and-inspection.md`](docs/checklists/inventory-and-inspection.md).
- **No RTC backup cell is fitted** (confirmed 2026-09-23), so the RTC loses time on every full
  power removal. Checklist 3.1 cannot pass until one is fitted.
- ~~**Four antennas have no radio behind them**~~ — **resolved 2026-09-30.** `ANT2`/`ANT3`/`ANT5`/`ANT6`
  are fed by the AC1200, which arrived, was installed, and is fully verified: `wlan1` monitor mode on
  2.4/5/6 GHz, and `hci1` passive-BLE behaviour (no `bluetoothd` auto-scan/connect, passive scan
  allowed). All AC1200 checks closed — see [`hardware/specs/ac1200-mt7921.md`](hardware/specs/ac1200-mt7921.md).

## Where things belong

| If it is… | It goes in |
|---|---|
| A hardware fact about a board (chipset, pinout, dimensions, rating) | `hardware/specs/`, or `docs/reference/pinout-gpio.md` for GPIO |
| A link to an upstream datasheet or schematic | `hardware/datasheets/README.md` |
| A repeatable procedure someone follows step by step | `docs/runbooks/` |
| A pass/fail list run once at a milestone | `docs/checklists/` |
| Setup notes for one application | `software/<app>.md` |
| A file that gets copied onto the device | `configs/<subsystem>/` |
| A purchase, order, invoice, or warranty fact | `docs/records/` |
| Something learned about RF, independent of this device | `knowledge/<discipline>/learned/` |
| An observation, capture, or signal ID | `knowledge/<discipline>/findings/` |
| A dated account of what was done | `docs/logs/build-log.md` |
| Learning-platform curriculum (tracks, modules, lessons, labs, quizzes, glossary) | `webdash/curriculum/`; durable concept prose stays in `knowledge/*/learned/` and is pulled in with `@ref` |
| Locally-authored software (not a vendor app) | `<name>/` at repo root for the code; design/rationale in `docs/reference/<name>-architecture.md`; setup/ops notes in `software/<name>.md` |

Cross-link with **relative** links. Every new document should be reachable from
[`README.md`](README.md) or [`docs/documentation-index.md`](docs/documentation-index.md).

## Conventions

- **Verify markers.** Anything not yet confirmed on this hardware says so, in the sentence that
  makes the claim — "*unverified*", "verify before running", or a named command that settles it.
  Do not quietly promote a vendor claim to fact.
- **Estimates are labelled.** Numbers derived from component typicals (see
  [`docs/reference/power-budget.md`](docs/reference/power-budget.md)) are marked as estimates and
  name the command whose output replaces them.
- **UTC timestamps.** Location is recorded as city or Maidenhead grid only — never precise
  coordinates.
- **No secrets.** No keys, PSKs, passwords, tokens, captured credentials, or precise private
  locations. Meshtastic channel PSKs are generated on-device and never committed.
- **Binaries stay out.** `.gitignore` excludes images (`*.img`, `*.7z`, `*.zip`), raw IQ
  (`*.iq`, `*.cf32`, `*.cs8`, `*.cu8`, `*.sigmf-data`), Kismet logs, and lab outputs (`*.wav`,
  `*.csv`, `*.raw`). Reference them by location and checksum.
- **Licence.** Docs and media are CC BY 4.0, code and configs MIT, per [`LICENSE`](LICENSE). Keep
  third-party files (e.g. the Kismet-derived udev rules) listed in its exclusions, and link rather
  than copy external text.
- **Commands are runnable.** Prefer a shell block a person can paste over a description of what
  they should do. State the expected output when it is the point of the step.
- **Tables over paragraphs** for anything enumerable; checkbox lists for anything performed once.
- Markdown only, no HTML. Keep the existing heading style and roughly 100-column prose.

## Knowledge base rules

`knowledge/` is organized by discipline (`learned/`, `configs/`, `runbooks/`, `findings/`).
Copy a template from [`knowledge/_templates/`](knowledge/_templates/) rather than starting blank.
`learned/` holds durable understanding, `findings/` holds dated observations — do not mix them.

Legal posture, restated because it constrains content: this platform is for **receiving,
learning, and licensed transmitting**. Wardriving here means passive observation only — no
deauth, no handshake capture, no association, no cracking against any network without either
**owning it or holding written authorization to test it**. That carve-out is explicit, not
implied: `aircrack-ng` is installed (2026-09-21, see [`software/aircrack-ng.md`](software/aircrack-ng.md))
specifically for authorized WPA/WPA2 auditing — own gear or a documented engagement, nothing else.
Do not add material that assists intrusion against networks outside that boundary, decoding of
protected or encrypted communications, or unlicensed transmission. See the responsible-use
section in [`knowledge/README.md`](knowledge/README.md).

## Repository skills and agents

[`.claude/skills/hardware-project-repo/`](.claude/skills/hardware-project-repo/SKILL.md) generalizes
this repo's method — structure, sourcing rules, conflict map, staged configs, bring-up acceptance
checklists — for scaffolding and driving other hardware builds. It loads automatically in sessions
working here; see [`.claude/skills/README.md`](.claude/skills/README.md) to use it elsewhere.

Two read-only subagents support it: [`hw-research`](.claude/agents/hw-research.md) for per-component
sourcing (spawn one per component, in parallel) and [`repo-audit`](.claude/agents/repo-audit.md) for
an adversarial pass before committing a documentation batch. They report; this session commits.

[`doc-review`](.claude/agents/doc-review.md) (added 2026-09-23) checks that documented claims are
**still true**. It compares status claims ("pending", "not yet installed", "in transit", "still
inserted") against the newest dated evidence and the live device, using read-only commands. Every
line listed by [`.claude/scripts/doc-review-candidates.py`](.claude/scripts/doc-review-candidates.py)
gets a verdict. It runs **every 8 h of active working time**. A project hook
([`.claude/hooks/doc-review-timer.py`](.claude/hooks/doc-review-timer.py), wired in
[`.claude/settings.json`](.claude/settings.json) on `UserPromptSubmit` and `Stop`) counts the gaps
between events, ignoring any gap over 30 min. At 8 h it injects a reminder on each prompt until a
review is recorded. After a review, run `.claude/hooks/doc-review-timer.py --reset`; use `--status`
to see the clock. The clock state is per machine and lives in
`~/.local/state/clockworkpi-uconsole/`. The first two runs showed the verdicts vary between runs,
so treat an "ok" as likely rather than proven.

Seven more agents cover webdash design and learning (six added 2026-09-23, `senior-rf-engineer`
2026-09-24). All are read-only unless a prompt asks otherwise:

| Agent | Role |
|---|---|
| [`design-planner`](.claude/agents/design-planner.md) | Graphic design planning: information architecture, layout, visual system, per-component patterns |
| [`creative-director`](.claude/agents/creative-director.md) | Concept, voice, naming, motifs; keeps the Fancy theme legible and within the legal posture |
| [`web-ui-engineer`](.claude/agents/web-ui-engineer.md) | Turns a design into a buildable vanilla-JS spec; reviews UI code for accessibility, performance, untrusted data |
| [`syllabus-designer`](.claude/agents/syllabus-designer.md) | Curriculum built on `knowledge/` with a hands-on lab on this device per module |
| [`tutor`](.claude/agents/tutor.md) | Explains concepts using this device's real state; writes in-dashboard explainer content |
| [`guided-learning`](.claude/agents/guided-learning.md) | Step-by-step missions whose steps are checked against live webdash data |
| [`senior-rf-engineer`](.claude/agents/senior-rf-engineer.md) | Technical review: RF physics and numbers, and that every exercise fits Fancy's actual hardware and the legal posture |

## Git

- Work on a feature branch; do not commit to `main` directly.
- Commit messages: imperative subject, body explaining *why* the documentation changed and what
  is still unverified.
- Do not open pull requests unless asked.
